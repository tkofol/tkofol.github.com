Barry Ritholz at "The Big Picture":http://bigpicture.typepad.com has a great list of "lessons learned from Bear & Lehman":http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/09/the-terrible-le.html

To summarize:
* Don't just risk your company, risk the entire financial world.
* Be the first to Implode!   
* Engage in systemic risk so as your counter-parties are also threatened.
* Threaten an important part of the economy
* Your Balance Sheet is the only thing that matters

I would like to add one more, no one cares if your company goes under unless your product is a necessity to the rich. Watch the youtube video below for a little more perspective on this phenomenon.
