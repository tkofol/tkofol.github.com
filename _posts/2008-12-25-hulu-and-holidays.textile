First off, Happy Holidays to anybody who wanders on this post. 

Lately I have been relying more and more on the internet for my video content. "Hulu":http://hulu.com has given me a chance to watch shows I would normally miss out. I am loving it. Unlike my sister, I enjoy full episodes non of this 3 minute clip crap that drives youtube traffic. I like quality, full length programming. Hulu satisfies this itch. 

A couple holiday recommendations for your Hulu watching pleasure.

* "ReGenesis":http://www.hulu.com/regenesis - Like House but with more science.
* "FireFly":http://www.hulu.com/firefly - Fun Sci Fi drama created by Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel.
* "John Doe":http://www.hulu.com/john-doe - Quirky really smart guy, but is alien smart mystery
