I gave my girlfriend "Spice Girls":http://www.thespicegirls.com/ tickets for Christmas. Last night I accompanied my girlfriend and 2 of her women friends to a sold out TD Banknorth Arena. 

Enough back story,  here are the 5 things I learned last night and every straight male should know before attending a spice girls concert.

# No lines! Seriously you can get a beer faster at this show then you could at a Boston Bruins game. 
# No lines! The bathroom is empty.
# Excellent unintentional comedy. Watching mothers dance while their teenage daughter is mortified, always a funny site.
# When the Spice Girls cover "Its Raining Men" go get a snack.
# If you are older then thirty, don't go! If you do... you will be profiled as a pedophile.
