Friday night Berkeley, the lovable, yet slightly insane black lab puppy has joined Beacon in my household.

Again thank you Eileen Ketcham from "Grand View Labradors":http://grandviewlabradorretrievers.com/index.html for raising such a beautiful little puppy.

Beacon is Berkeley's half brother, "a brother from another mother", and have been getting along great. 

Berkeley's biggest drawback right now is she likes to "do her business in her crate", but our dog walkers who started taking over today did a fantastic job and went above and beyond the call of duty. "Doggie Daytrippers":http://www.doggiedaytrippers.com/ have done a fantastic job helping potty train young Berkeley. She messed her crate today and they cleaned it up and set some fresh bedding. They are a fantastic service and I highly recommend them.
