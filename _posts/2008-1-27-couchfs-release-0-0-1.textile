Well I haven't given this project much love lately. I took a little time out this weekend and stabilized it (a little) and added the much needed feature of specifying the database url and port.

It is still missing lots of features, (all files and views are still readonly) but i would rather release it then sit on it.

You can download it at "CouchFS download page":http://code.google.com/p/couchfs/downloads/list.

For those who don't know...

CouchFS is a MacFUSE file system that allows you access to CouchDB databases and files. Using CouchFS will allow you to mount your CouchDB system and edit/browse CouchDB files like any typical file on your OS X file system.
