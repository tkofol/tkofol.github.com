title: Orb Audio - Simple Awesome Sound

I just acquired two "Orb Audio Mod 1 speakers":http://www.orbaudio.com/ and they kick ass! Whats even more refreshing is their business model. They focus on simple high quality products. The really only sell 2 products a round speaker the size of a CD and a sub woofer. But the round speakers are very modular so that they can be combined into different combinations.

They do not sell their products through distributors, instead they choose to only sell through their website. Distributors markups are often on the order of 3 times what the manufacture would sell the same product for. Orb Audio would rather supply costumers with high quality products without the excessive markup, selling through the internet allows them to avoid the middleman (you gotta hate the middleman).  

The speakers they sell are great looking, most speakers are Ugly!, but these babies are small and well designed. I am certainly no audiophile but to me the sound kicks ass, you will be amazed at how big the sound is.
