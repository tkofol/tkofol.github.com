Opinions on the war in Iraq may differ, but everyone should wish for the safe return of all our troops.

My brother Mike is currently situated in Kuwait and will be going into Iraq on Thursday for his first tour. He always says he doesn't need luck the enemy does, well I want to wish him the best of luck anyway. 

Love you.
