title: RubyInline Link Errors on Leopard
tags: [technology]

For those of you who have upgraded to OS X Leopard and tried to use RubyInline. You might have been greeted with lots of Compilation Errors.

Well after a couple hours of googling, i found the solutions "here":http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/ruby/wiki/Troubleshooting.

Turns out Ruby built on Leopard is built without the compilation flag saying ignore missing symbols when linking.

The temporary hack to fix it, is to go into the RubyInline gem directory and find lib/inline.rb file and change the line that looks like this

<macro:code lang="ruby">
flags = @flags.join(' ')
</macro:code>

to this

<macro:code lang="ruby">
flags = @flags.join(' ') + ' -lruby'
</macro:code>

Now everything should work. Hopefully the next RubyInline version will fix this problem, so I don't have to hack it again.
