Sometime ago I created a simple YouTube Alarm Clock mashup called "AlarmTube":http://alarmtube.highimpactnoise.com 

Well I just did a google search for AlarmTube and some other site (I will not give them the satisfaction of linking to them) stole the idea and the name. The real AlarmTube is a lot more sweet, but I am pretty pissed this guy didn't do a little more homework.

There is obviously room on the internet for competition, but it is annoying when someone just rips your idea. I certainly did not copyright the name AlarmTube, as there is not enough money in YouTube Alarm Clock mashups (surprising huh). 

Long live the real AlarmTube and F*** U Fake AlarmTube.
