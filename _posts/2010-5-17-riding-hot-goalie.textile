Common wisdom in the NHL is that a "goalie can carry a team in the playoffs":http://www.examiner.com/x-11395-Philadelphia-Sports-Examiner~y2010m4d29-Hot-goalie-may-decide-FlyersBruins-series. The  "Bruins / Flyers":http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/15/sports/hockey/15flyers.html series was a blueprint about the fallacy of this commonly accepted wisdom.  "Tucca Rask":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuukka_Rask  was the hot goalie coming into the series, while the Flyers had to resort to their backup goalie after  "Michael Leighton":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Leighton after Brian Boucher went down with an injury. What happens, Flyers win and everybody in Boston is asking why didn't Claude Julien replace Tucca in games 6 or 7.

The fact of the matter is, there is not a huge difference between goalies in the NHL. I just finished reading  "Stumbling on Wins":http://www.amazon.com/Stumbling-Wins-Economists-Pitfalls-Professional/dp/013235778X  were two economist take the  "Moneyball":http://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393057658  approach to dissect other sports statistics. 

What they found was that over a course of an 82 game season the best season ever by a goalie Curtis Joseph (92-93) only provided 8 wins more than an average goalie. To make it more clear how close the best goalie and an average goalie are:

"Brodeur's carrer performance after the 2008-09 season was only worth 33.5 Wins Above Average. Remember Broduer is the all-time leader in career wins. If Brodeur was replaced by an average goalie, though, this average goalie would be ranked second all-time with 524 career wins.

Just to give you a comparison, in the 2008-2009 basketball season, Chris Paul led the league Wins Above Average with 22.0. 
 
So layoff Tucca, whether him or another goalie probably would not have made a difference. Goalies just don't matter as much as everyone thinks.
