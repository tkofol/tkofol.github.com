Now what successful means is another story, but he, my girlfriend and I are having fun, even if it involves a little less sleep.

I want to thank the breeder for "Eileen Ketcham of Grandview Labs":http://www.grandviewlabradorretrievers.com for raising such a cute and healthy dog. 

Info: If you live in the Boston area come check out the South End dog bakery "Polka Dog":http://www.polkadog.com/press_bherald.htm, their raw hide alternative is saving my furniture some unfortunate chewing
