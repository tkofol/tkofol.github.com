title: Frying My Brain on MBA Essays
tags:

I am on my n-teenth MBA essay today, and my brain is freakin in an infinite loop. I am learning to like writing, aka this blog, but it still doesn't come naturally to me. Furthermore writing about yourself is difficult, there is no topic I find harder to think about then myself.

Good news is I think this exercise is healthy. Healthy like a colonoscopy is healthy, but healthy nonetheless.

Back to work, back to writing why I kick ass. Try it, in the end it feels pretty good.
