Ever heard of "Randy Newsom?":https://www.realsportsinvestments.com/Player_Profile.php Probably not!

He is a 25 year old minor league relief pitcher for the Cleveland Indians, and for $20 dollars you can get a piece of his future income.

bq. RSI is currently offering 4% of his future major league salary at the price of $50,000. RSI is selling shares of Randy Newsom for $20/Share. 2,500 total shares will be sold.

What it basically comes down to, is for every share sold you get 16 dollars for every million Randy makes. I see both the positive and negative in this new style of sports investing.

The positive being this money will provide Randy with more money and probably more time in the minor leagues, giving him a better shot of making it to the pro's. 

On the flip side you can see this going down hill quickly with people making large bets in young kids. Giving them too much money before they made it to the pros and having to put the interests of their shareholders above their own.

It will be interesting to watch if this tactic becomes more prevalent, but good luck to Randy.
