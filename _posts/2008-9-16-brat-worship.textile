I will be sharing interesting quotes from my readings and school experience.

From the guy who brought you the "Johnsonville Brat":http://www.johnsonville.com/home.html, talking about the changes he implemented in his business to encourage the employees take responsibility for the business.

bq. A grand plan was impossible, there were too many variables. I wasn't certain which system to change; I just knew I had to change something in order to alter expectations and begin moving toward my goal.

In life or in business we often trick ourselves in to feeling in control, but there are always too many variables. Sometimes you just need to tinker until you put the variables in balance.
