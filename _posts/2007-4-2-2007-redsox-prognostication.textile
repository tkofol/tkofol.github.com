Spring is finally here as the Boston Redsox begin their 2007 season today. Ahhh don't you get warm and fuzzy just thinking about it.

Without further ado, here are my 2007 predictions.

*Sox Pitchers:*

* Curt Schilling: 16-7 4.10 Enough to get him a 2008 contract
* Josh Beckett: 15-9 4.25 Improvement but I ain't buying the hype
* Daisuke Matsuzaka: 18-6 3.65 I am buying Dice-K
* Tim Wakefield: 13-12 4.80 Typical
* Julian Tavarez 4-6 5.20 Replaced by Lester by the All Start Break
* Jonathan Papelbon 48 Saves 0.95 Era - Cy Young Winner

*Sox Hitters*

# Julio Lugo .280 AVG 13 HR 24 SB 95 Runs - Solid Leadoff Guy
# Kevin Youkilis .265 AVG 19 HR 85 RBI - Improved Power Numbers
# David Ortiz .290 AVG 48 HR 120 RBI - 5 Walk Off's, The usual
# Manny Ramirez  .305 AVG 32 HR 105 RBI 4 Manny Moments - Disappointing Season
# J.D. Drew  .290 AVG 25 HR 100 RBI - Flourishes in Boston
# Mike Lowell .260 AVG 14 HR 60 RBI - Continues second half slump from last year. Traded near the deadline
# Jason Varitek .245 AVG 12 HR 60 RBI - Boston starts looking for Tek's replacement
# Coco Crisp .300 AVG 15 HR 70 RBI 25 SB - Nice bounce back year
# Dustin Pedroia .290 AVG 6 HR 70 RBI - Solid Rookie Year, 4th in Rookie of the year voting

*AL*
