title: Just Give Me An Accurate Time Estimate
tags: [life]
---
I recently had the pleasure of moving from one apartment to the next. Everyone was late, the movers, the cable guy, and when I called to check on what was going on, no one could give me an accurate time estimate.

Why is this so hard? 

Removing the uncertainty of when someone is going to show up really help ease the mental burden. That is why progress bars are so comforting, even if their accuracy is not 100 percent. So why can't there  progress bars in other industries. My mind would have been put at ease if I could have seen where the cable guy was in his daily routine and his estimated time of getting to my place. Same goes for the movers, instead of having me call up 30 times wondering where in the world they were just give me a little GPS action on the truck. Maybe there are some technical challenges but man customer satisfaction would leap off the page.

I live in Boston and one of the most aggravating things is waiting for the T, not knowing how long until the next one is going to arrive. When I was in London guess what they have accurate time estimates when the next subway train will arrive. 

Mental anxiety eased. Uncertainty removed.
