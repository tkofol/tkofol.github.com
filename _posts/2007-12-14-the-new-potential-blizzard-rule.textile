A colleague of mine never commutes if there is a threat of a snowstorm, instead choosing to work from home. It often brings him a little **** busting, but as of  today I am instituting the potential blizzard rule in my life.

It took me almost 5 hours to get home from work today. A drive that usually take 40 minutes. FIVE FREAKIN HOURS. So next potential blizzard it is going to be just me and my laptop.
