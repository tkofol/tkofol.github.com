After a thanksgiving weekend of traveling in which I had connecting flights both to Florida and back to Boston. I wish I had known about a website called "flightwait.com":http://www.flightwait.com/ earlier. This site is a google maps mashup, that shows you where the flight delays are.

It might have eased my flying mind, though I bet it probably would have made me more anxious. 

It is the old philosophical question, is ignorance really bliss? Such speculation leads nicely into me to my next to blog post, would you pay to have your genome decoded?
