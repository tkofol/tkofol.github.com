Before the season started I made my predictions on how the 2007 Red Sox baseball season would go. Man was I off. But I will face up to my errors.

First congratulations to the Sox, even though I had predicted a Dodgers victory, I am happy that the title went to the Sox.

*Sox Pitchers:*

*Curt Schilling* 
* Projected 16-7 4.10 
* Actual 9-8 3.87 
* Probably not enough to get him a contract extension
*Josh Beckett* 
* Projected 15-9 4.25 
* Actual 20-7 3.27 
* I was way off on Becket, the guy incredible.
*Daisuke Matsuzaka* 
* Projected 18-6 3.65 
* Actual 15-12 4.40 
* A Becket like first year, hopefully he will make the same leap Becket made
*Tim Wakefield* 
* Projected 13-12 4.80 
* Actual 17 - 12 4.76 
* As expected
*Julian Tavarez* 
* Projected 4-6 5.20 
* Actual 7 - 11 5.15 
* Lasted a little longer into the season the I expected.
*Jonathan Papelbon* 
* Projected 48 Saves 0.95 Era 
* Actual 37 Save 1.85 
* Thought he might have a chance at the Cy, didn't happen this year but it isn't out of the realm of possibility. 

*Sox Hitters*

*Julio Lugo*
* Projected .280 AVG 13 HR 24 SB 95 Runs 
* Actual .237 AVG 8 HR 33 SB 71 Runs
* He looked much better in Tampa
*Kevin Youkilis*
* Projected .265 AVG 19 HR 85 RBI 
* Actual .288 AVG 16 HR 83 RBI
* Just a good hitter and lead the league in sweating
* Improved Power Numbers
*David Ortiz* 
* Projected  .290 AVG 48 HR 120 RBI

* A little less power but hopefully knee surgery will get him back 
*Manny Ramirez*  
* Projected.305 AVG 32 HR 105 RBI
* Actual .296 AVG 20 HR 88 RBI
* Below average season, Manny skills may start deteriorating

* Next year is his breakout year ... maybe?

3 for 8 in predicting who would make the playoffs. Well I would be a pretty productive hitter with that average. Already looking forward to next season.
