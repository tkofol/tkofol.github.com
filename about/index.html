    <h3> About Me </h3>
    <p>Hi, my name is Tim Kofol. I am currently working as a strategic marketing consultant for a startup med-tech firm in the diagnostics space. My work experience has primarily been in product development for a medical device company, though I have some (and increasing) business development and marketing experience. I just completed my MBA with a concentration in entrepreneurship. I am always looking for exciting new opportunities in the medtech / technology space.

    This blog is occasionally updated with my thoughts, though increasingly it aggregates pieces from web that I find interesting. My passion is for the intersection of life science technology and the web. This trend is shaping the healthcare landscape, driving consumers to be more active participants in their own care. </p>
